Stalking my girl is a pain. How about blocking her social media profiles to regain my focus?

Stalking my girl is a real pain, the urge to see what she doing is too much to resist. How about blocking her profile so that I can no longer stalk her? Thats what this code does. It works by modifying the host file from your pc, blocking specific links for your desired amount of time. Though it can be done manually but my intention was automating it. So decided to write the code and here it is.

Or,
Basically you can block any link(s) by slightly modifying the code. You can do the same task with different ad-blocker extensions but they are browser specific and if you have two or more browsers setting up blocking rules on all browsers is just time consuming than simply modifying the host file on your PC. This code will modify your host file for yourself so you do not need to manually locate the host file and edit it.
